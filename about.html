            <h2>Our story</h2>
            <p>
                In the aftermath of the dissolution of one of the largest networks for women in tech in 2024, the women
                of our London community decided to continue our mission in a new community: to empower all women in the
                tech space. United by a common goal and fueled by a shared passion, our tight-knit community joined
                forces, bringing their experience, diverse talents and perspectives to the table.
